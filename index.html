        Chevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets
        worldwide. In Oceania, Chevrolet is represented by Holden Special
        Vehicles, having returned to the region in 2018 after a 50-year absence
        with the launching of the Camaro and Silverado pickup truck (HSV was
        partially and formerly owned by GM subsidiary Holden, which GM retired
        in 2021). In 2005, Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe, primarily selling
        vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline "Daewoo has
        grown up enough to become Chevrolet", a move rooted in General Motors'
        attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet. With the
        reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe, GM intended Chevrolet to be a
        mainstream value brand, while GM's traditional European
        standard-bearers, Opel of Germany and Vauxhall of the United Kingdom,
        would be moved upmarket. However, GM reversed this move in late 2013,
        announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe from 2016
        onward, with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette. Chevrolet
        vehicles were to continue to be marketed in the CIS states, including
        Russia. After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create
        GM Korea, the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued
        in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet.

        The Chevrolet Corvette, colloquially known as the 'Vette, is a
        two-door, two-passenger luxury sports car manufactured and marketed
        by Chevrolet across more than 60 years of production and eight design
        generations. From 1953 to 2019, it was front-engined, and since
        2020, it is mid-engined. With its generations noted sequentially from
        C1 to C8, the Corvette serves as Chevrolet's halo vehicle and is noted
        for its performance and distinctive plastic bodywork, either fiberglass
        or composite. In 1953, GM executives accepted a suggestion by Myron
        Scott, then the assistant director of the Public Relations department,
        to name the company's new sports car after the small maneuverable
        warship. The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the 1953
        GM Motorama as a concept car; production models went on sale later that
        year. In 1963, the second generation was introduced in coupe and
        convertible styles. Originally manufactured in Flint, Michigan, and St.
        Louis, Missouri, the Corvette has since 1981 been manufactured in
        Bowling Green, Kentucky. The Corvette has become widely known as
        "America's Sports Car. Automotive News wrote that after being
        featured in the early 1960s television show Route 66, "the Corvette
        became synonymous with freedom and adventure," ultimately becoming both
        "the most successful concept car in history and the most popular sports
        car in history."

        GMC, formerly the General Motors Truck Company, or the GMC Truck & Coach
        Division (of General Motors Corporation), is a division of the American
        automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM) that primarily focuses on
        trucks and utility vehicles. GMC currently makes SUVs, pickup trucks,
        vans, and light-duty trucks, catered to a premium-based market. In the
        past, GMC also produced fire trucks, ambulances, heavy-duty trucks,
        military vehicles, motorhomes, transit buses, and medium duty trucks.
        While many GMC and Chevrolet trucks are mechanically similar, GMC is
        positioned as a premium offering to the mainstream Chevrolet brand, with
        luxury vehicles such as the Denali series and the electric, off-road
        Hummer EV series. In North America, GMC vehicles are almost always sold
        alongside Buick vehicles at joint dealerships, allowing the same dealer
        to market both upscale cars and trucks.
